# Titanic Machine Learning Project

This project is part of the **Kaggle Titanic Challenge**, a requirement for the **University of Tokyo Matsuo-Iwasawa Laboratory's Global Consumer Intelligence Courses Assignment**. The challenge is to use machine learning to predict which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck.

## Project Overview

The Titanic Machine Learning Project aims to predict passenger survival using various machine learning techniques. This is an introductory project, focused on data analysis, feature engineering, and model building, to develop a practical understanding of data science and machine learning.
